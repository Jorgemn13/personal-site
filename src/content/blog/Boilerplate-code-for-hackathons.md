I built the template [Vanadium](https://github.com/unapt/Vanadium) to speed up the common set-up process for web apps using Python with FastAPI on the backend and Nextjs with Tailwind and Chakra-UI for the frontend.

## Doesn't NextJS already have a backend?

Yes, but this was made for mainly two reasons:

- Fast set-up for 24-hour hackathons
- Python on the backend makes using machine learning libraries much easier

This allows your team to build fast AI type web apps. If that is not what you are building, then don't waste your time using this.

## How to get started

1. Go to [Vanadium](https://github.com/unapt/Vanadium) on Github
2. Click on 'Use this template'
3. Follow README.md insturctions
4. Profit
